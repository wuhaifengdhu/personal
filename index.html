          <p>Dear Miss Liu(I suppose it should be “Miss” instead of “Ms.”),</p>

<p>I found out that you seemed to like using English while I was reading your ppt,so I decide to write you in English regardless of my limited level.</p>

<p>I'm the kind of persons who may look shy and timid,and in my view even like a nerd at first.But as you dig deeper,you will find me “interesting”(according to my roommates and close friends).I know well that how my shyness has got in my way as I could have done better,but it needs some time to do a change.I love literature,singing and painting from a very young age.In fact,I have a vast range of hobbies.For example,I love DIY.I think the best gift is a delicate one made with one's own creativity and whole heart.I also like to write when I feel an impetus.</p>

<p>I appreciate a variety of films.I admire those that can stimulate a feeling of beauty and romance.I like disney cartoons based on the exquisite fairytales.I like classics such as  and
dramas like .I like ,, and films of those sorts.Jiang Wen's  was once my favorite.But now my favorite film is Roberto Benigni's(Life Is Beautiful).It's so cruel but real,so sorrowful but beautiful.I feel that my father is just like the great father in the film,equally wise and brave and observant and filled with love and sense of responsibility,though perhaps not talking that much. The film touched me deeply and I believe that my future partner should also be a true “man” like my father or the father in the film even though he might be simply ordinary and not look attractive.What matters is the valuable heart that glitters inside.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I haven't read very much though I truly love reading.There's a great distance to be covered.At present,if I really have to pick up one of the works I've read as my favorite,then it might be  while my roommate on my upper berth teased and argued that  is much better.Well,I can't ensure which is better as I have never read .Before I read it on my own I'd better not rush to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Music also plays an important part in human life.Before I went to university,music had always been a necessity to me.It's really a pity that we are deprived of our freedom to sing as the dorm assigned to us is too small and crowded and little personal space is remained.I like various music but I really hate so-called postmodernism concerning all sorts of art forms.Actually,I think we are not stepping forward but falling to hell.My favorite classical music is Chopin's nocturne.It's so beautiful and romantic that everytime I listen to it I am deeply drawn in the fascinating fantasy.BTW,the intermezzo of the opera  really sweeps me off my feet.My preferences to music can be clarified into 3 periods.When I was in primary school I like Chineses pop stars like S.H.E like many other kids did.As time elapsed,I fell for Asian especially Korean pop stars when I progressed to middle and high school.It was a trend then.I remember my favorite star was BoA.I bought almost all her albums and practised singing every song of her.BoA was a legend in my eyes,representing a dream come true.Yes,I had long wishing to be a talented singer since I was still in kindergarten until I finished my high school and realized that my dream was unlikely to be filled in the former way I'd been so long holding to. BoA worked so hard and managed to live just another possible life I could have lived.I adored her as she meant so much to me.</p>

<p>Of course,I've always loved American and European music since I attended primary school.Now I'm in the third period——that is,no particular enthusiasms.</p>

<p>As for the greatest thing I've ever achieved,I bet it is those hard efforts I made to pass the P.E. test,which was part of the high school entrance examination in my hometown,Hunan province.At first,I could at most jump 1.53 meters long,which had never been broken before.Everytime I ran the 800 race,I just wouldn't pass and was out of breath and exhausted to death.It was such days I will never forget and whenever I look back upon them I inevitably feel proud.On the day the test was taken,I could already jump to 1.93 meters far and finish my 800 race in 3.2 minutes while the passing lines for both were respecfully 1.70 meters and 4.5 minutes.It was those days of great pressure that made a grown young adult out of the me.</p>

<p>Tremendously influenced by my parents,I deeply believe that whatever you come across,you should always try to be a good man and behave correctly.”Never lose yourself.”Morality and faith are two of the things I treasure most.I am convinced that people are ought to hold tight to their moral principles and ethical beliefs——that is what distinguishes humans from any other creatures.</p>

<p>Speaking of my university life,I expect that I will become a real “woman” of both humanistic compassion and logical thinking via extensive reading.English learning is another essential part of my university life.Anyway,working hard is the only key to the path.
It seems that I have chattered too much about myself.Actually you can just skip some unimportant parts .Thanks for taking your time.I’m looking forward to the following time we’ll spend together.</p>
